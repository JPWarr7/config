# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

A starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).

# My configuration

This is my personal configuration for LazyVim. You can use it as a starting point for your own configuration.
I have added some plugins and key mappings that I find useful, alongside LSP support for the languages I primarily use.
